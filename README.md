# File Descriptions

## get_data

A webscraper built using Selenium and Pandas in python. This scraper performs the following tasks:

1. navigates to the toronto real estate market page on [REALTOR.ca](https://www.realtor.ca/).
2. filters results for only houses.
3. collects specific information about each listing on the page.
4. handles pagination automatically to prevent manual intervention.
5. creates a dataframe to store listing information

## get_data_singular
    
This scraper does everything in the original scraper but is not as robust. Manual intervention is needed to go from page to page because I could not afford services that resolve captchas.

## Listings*

All listings csv files are the result of putting all the data collected into dataframes for use in future projects.
